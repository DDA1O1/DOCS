- OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming.It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of `objects`, everything is object in OOPs.
- OOPs is not a language, it is a concept.Almost all languages support OOPs approach.
- `main()` function exist without any class in C++.That means it supports variety of programming styles.
- Bjarne Stroustrup introduced OOPs in C++ in 1985 [OOPSLA](https://stroustrup.com/oopsla.pdf)

### Class and Object
- Class is a blueprint of an object.
- Object is an instance of a class.
- Every new object instance is a copy of original class.

> `<vector>` is a class and `vector<int> v` is an object/instance of that class.
- same as array, but more flexible.
- `vector` allows fast random access to any element.
- It is preferred when random-access performance is the primary need.
- [vector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/vector-class?view=msvc-170) is a class in C++ STL

```cpp
// user defined class
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Bread {
    public:
        // data members(attributes) fancy name for variables in a class
        string name;
        int quantity;
        vector<string> ingredients; //list of ingredients

        // member functions(methods) fancy name for functions in a class
        void display() {
            cout << "Bread name: " << name << endl;
            cout << "Quantity: " << quantity << endl;
            cout << "Ingredients: ";
            for (string ingredient : ingredients) {
                cout << ingredient << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
}; // do not forget semicolon

// access modifier
// public: accessible from anywhere
// private: accessible only within the class
// protected: accessible within the class and derived classes

// The default access modifier for a class is private if not specified.

int main() {
    Bread bread; // class name always starts with capital letter and object name always starts with small letter

    bread.name = "Whole Wheat Bread";
    bread.quantity = 10;
    bread.ingredients = {"Flour", "Water", "Yeast", "Salt"};

    bread.display();

    Bread bread2;
    bread2.name = "White Bread";
    bread2.quantity = 5;
    bread2.ingredients = {"Flour", "Water", "Yeast", "Salt"};
    bread2.display();
    return 0;
}
