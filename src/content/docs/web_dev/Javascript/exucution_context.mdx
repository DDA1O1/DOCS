## What is Execution Context?

Execution context is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that defines the environment where code is executed. Think of it as a container that stores:

1. The code being executed
2. The variables and functions available to that code
3. The value of the `this` keyword
4. The outer environment reference (scope chain)

## Why Does Execution Context Matter?

Understanding execution context is crucial because it:

1. Explains how JavaScript manages scope and variable access
2. Helps you understand hoisting behavior
3. Clarifies how `this` binding works
4. Explains closure mechanisms
5. Is essential for debugging and understanding call stack

## How Execution Context Works

### Types of Execution Context

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**
   - Created when JavaScript engine starts running your code
   - Creates two important things:
     - Global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js)
     - `this` keyword (points to global object in non-strict mode)
   - Serves as the base execution context

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**
   - Created whenever a function is called
   - Each function gets its own execution context
   - Multiple FECs can exist during runtime

### Execution Context Lifecycle

1. **Creation Phase (Memory Creation)**
   - Creates the global object (for GEC)
   - Sets up memory space for variables and functions

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Executes code line by line
   - Assigns actual values to variables
   - Executes function calls (creating new execution contexts)

## Execution Context Visualization

```javascript
let value1 = 20;
let value2 = 30;

function addValues(val1, val2) {
    let sum = val1 + val2;
    return sum;
}

addValues(value1, value2);
let result = addValues(6, 9);
```
