### History

- Netscape wanted to make the web more interactive.They needed a scripting language that is easy to use and can be executed in the browser.Without needing a full page reload.
- They hired Brendan Eich and he created the language in 10 days.The intense pressure was due to the fact that Microsoft was also developing a similar product called JScript.
- They named it as LiveScript but later changed it to Javascript when Java was very popular to leverage the popularity of Java.
- [ECMA International](https://www.ecma-international.org/) standardized the language in 1997 and named it as ECMAScript(ES) due to compatibility issues between internet explorer and netscape.
- Due to its rushed development,the language has some wierd behaviours initially which was later fixed with each new [ECMAScript version](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/).
- For example,the typeof operator used to return "object" for null.

```javascript
console.log(typeof null); // "object"
```

### Setting up the runtime environment

- Download runtime environment such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Deno](https://deno.com/).Traditionally,Javascript was used only on the client side(in the browser). Node.js is the most popular runtime environment with vast ecosystem of libraries(npm).It was developed by [Ryan Dahl](https://x.com/rough__sea) in 2009, also creter of Deno.Built on the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8) (the same engine used by Chrome), Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript to build server applications, command-line tools, APIs, and more.


- Install any IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Hello World in Node.js

- Check if node is installed by running `node -v` in the terminal.

```bash
$ node -v
v18.16.0
```

- Create a new folder for your project and open it in your IDE.Create a new file called index.js and save it in the folder.

```javascript
// index.js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

- Open the terminal and run `node index.js` in the folder.Run the command to start the server.

```bash
$ node index.js
Hello World!
```

### Variables and Constants

- Variables are used to store data that can be changed during the execution of the program.
- Constants are used to store data that cannot be changed during the execution of the program.

```javascript
let variableName = "value";
const constantName = "value";
var variableName2 = "value";
```
:::caution[var]
 **var** is used to declare a variable in older versions of Javascript.It is not recommended to use var in modern Javascript.Due to its function scope,it passes the value of local variable to the global scope.This can lead to unexpected behaviour in the code.
:::

## Data Types

- Javascript has two types of data types:Primitive and Non-Primitive.
- Primitive data types are immutable(cannot be changed).
- Non-Primitive data types are mutable(can be changed).
- This categorisation reflects how JavaScript manages data in memory and how programs access this data. Primitive types are stored directly in memory, while non-primitive types store references to their data. For a deeper understanding, check out the [MDN documentation on JavaScript data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).

### Primitive Data Types

- **Call by value:** When a primitive data type is assigned to a variable, a copy of the value is created and stored in the new variable. Changes to one variable don't affect the other since each has its own independent copy of the data.

```javascript
// Example of call by value
let x = 10;
let y = x;  // y gets a copy of x's value

y = 20;  // modifying y doesn't affect x
console.log(x);  // 10
console.log(y);  // 20
```

- **String:** Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Number:** Represents numeric values.
- **BigInt:** Represents numeric values that are too large to be represented by the Number type.
- **Boolean:** Represents a boolean value.
- **Null:** Represents a null value.
- **Undefined:** Represents an undefined value.
- **Symbol:** Used to create unique identifiers for objects.

### Non-Primitive Data Types

- **Call by reference:** When a non-primitive data type is assigned to a variable, the variable stores a reference (memory address) to the data rather than the actual data itself. This means multiple variables can point to the same data in memory, and modifying the data through one variable affects all references to that data.

```javascript
// Example of call by reference
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;  // arr2 references the same array as arr1

arr2.push(4);
console.log(arr1);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr2);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- **Array:** Represents a collection of elements.
- **Object:** Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
- **Function:** Represents a function.

## Type Conversion

- Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another.
- When we are fetching data from a database or an API,or taking input from the user,we do not know whether the data is of the type we expect.Type conversion is used to handle such situations.

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = "2";
console.log(a + b); // "12"

// Here,Javascript automatically converts the number 1 to a string and concatenates it with the string "2".

let a = "124abc";
let num = Number(a);
console.log(num); // NaN
console.log(typeof num); // "number"

// Here,Javascript automatically converts the string "124abc" to a number.But since the string is not a valid number,it returns NaN.The typeof operator still returns "number".

let a = null;
console.log(a); // null
console.log(typeof a); // "object"
let num = Number(a);
console.log(num); // 0
console.log(typeof num); // "number"

// "25" => 25
// true => 1
// false => 0
// null => 0
// undefined => NaN
// "25abc" => NaN
// "abc" => NaN
// {} => NaN
// [] => 0
// [1,2,3] => NaN
// (function(){}) => NaN
// Symbol => NaN
// Boolean => true or false
// "true" => true
// "false" => true
// "" => false
```
:::tip[TypeScript]
TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds static typing to help catch errors during development and prevent unexpected type-related behaviors.

```typescript
// TypeScript will catch these errors during development
function calculateTotal(price: number, quantity: number): number {
    return price * quantity;
}

calculateTotal(10, 2);     // ✅ Works fine: 20
calculateTotal("10", 2);   // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
calculateTotal(10, "2");   // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'

// In regular JavaScript, these would silently convert types and potentially cause bugs
// "10" * 2    -> 20
// 10 * "2"    -> 20
// "10" * "2"  -> 20
```
:::

## Operator Precedence

- Operator precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
- For example,in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`,the multiplication operator `*` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`.So,it is evaluated first.

```javascript
console.log(2 + 3 * 4); // 14
```
- To learn more about operator precedence,visit [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

:::danger[Best Practices]
**Do not rely on operator precedence.Use parentheses to make the code more readable.**

```javascript
console.log((2 + 3) * 4); // 20
```
:::

## Prefix and Postfix Operators

- Prefix operators are operators that are placed before the operand.
- Postfix operators are operators that are placed after the operand.

```javascript
let a = 1;
console.log(++a); // 2
console.log(a); // 2
console.log(a++); // 2
console.log(a); // 3
```
- To learn more about prefix and postfix operators,visit [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment).

### Comparison Operators

- Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
- The result of a comparison is a boolean value.

```javascript
console.log(2 == "2"); // true
console.log(2 === "2"); // false
console.log(2 != "2"); // false
console.log(2 !== "2"); // true

console.log(null > 0); // false
console.log(null == 0); // false 
console.log(null >= 0); // true

// The reason for the above behaviour is that the comparison operator converts null to a number,treating it as 0.That is why null >= 0 is true and null > 0 is false.Equality check == does not convert null to a number.That is why null == 0 is false.

// To avoid such confusion,it is recommended to use the strict equality operator ===.Write code in a way that does not rely on type conversion.Clean code is always preferred.
```
