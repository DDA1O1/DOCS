## History

- Netscape wanted to make the web more interactive.They needed a scripting language that is easy to use and can be executed in the browser.Without needing a full page reload.
- They hired Brendan Eich and he created the language in 10 days.The intense pressure was due to the fact that Microsoft was also developing a similar product called JScript.
- They named it as LiveScript but later changed it to Javascript when Java was very popular to leverage the popularity of Java.
- [ECMA International](https://www.ecma-international.org/) standardized the language in 1997 and named it as ECMAScript(ES) due to compatibility issues between internet explorer and netscape.
- Due to its rushed development,the language has some wierd behaviours initially which was later fixed with each new [ECMAScript version](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/).

### Setting up the runtime environment

- Download runtime environment such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Deno](https://deno.com/).Traditionally,Javascript was used only on the client side(in the browser). Node.js is the most popular runtime environment with vast ecosystem of libraries(npm).It was developed by [Ryan Dahl](https://x.com/rough__sea) in 2009, also creter of Deno.Built on the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8) (the same engine used by Chrome), Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript to build server applications, command-line tools, APIs, and more.


- Install any IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Hello World in Node.js

- Check if node is installed by running `node -v` in the terminal.

```bash
$ node -v
v18.16.0
```

- Create a new folder for your project and open it in your IDE.Create a new file called index.js and save it in the folder.

```javascript
// index.js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

- Open the terminal and run `node index.js` in the folder.Run the command to start the server.

```bash
$ node index.js
Hello World!
```
