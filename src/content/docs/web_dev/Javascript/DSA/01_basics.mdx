## DSA

- It's all about how to store, organize data and which algorithm to use so to achieve a desired outcome.
- To know which algorithm to use which would be independent of the Cpu speed and architecture. Its is also called algorithm efficiency.

### Algorithm Efficiency

Algorithm efficiency is measured in terms of two key metrics:

<TimeComplexityChart />

1. **Time Complexity**
   - How runtime grows with input size
   - Expressed in Big O notation
   - Common complexities:
     - O(1): Constant time
     - O(log n): Logarithmic
     - O(n): Linear
     - O(n log n): Log-linear
     - O(n²): Quadratic
     - O(2ⁿ): Exponential

2. **Space Complexity**
   - Memory usage relative to input size
   - Also expressed in Big O notation
   - Includes:
     - Input space
     - Auxiliary space (extra space used)



#### Analyzing Efficiency

When evaluating an algorithm, consider:
- Best case scenario
- Average case scenario
- Worst case scenario (most commonly used)

#### Trade-offs

- Time vs Space: Often need to balance between speed and memory usage
- Readability vs Performance: Sometimes simpler code is preferred over slightly better performance
- Development time vs Optimization: Consider if optimization is worth the development effort
