title: Why Docs
description: A guide.
---

- Anything can be *`Learned`* as long as you have well written documentation for it.
- **I cannot emphasize enough the importance of having well-written documentation.**
- Although majority of the Documentaions were written by the developers themselves cause they know what they are talking about.But they were not necessarily trained in how to write well.
- So, they expect you to be well versed with the prerequisites beffore reading the documentation.

### Goal 

- Create documentation as a reliable reference point - don't rely solely on memory.
- **Avoid Tutorial Hell:** Focus on building rather than endless learning.
- Take action instead of getting stuck in the research phase.
