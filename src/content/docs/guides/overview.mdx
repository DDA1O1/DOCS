title: Why Docs
description: A guide.
---

- Documentaion is the fastest way to learn anything.If you don't want to be stuck in tutorial hell, start doing it and write about it.
- Although majority of the Documentaions were written by the developers themselves cause they know what they are talking about.But they were not necessarily trained in how to write well.
- So, they expect you to be well versed with the prerequisites beffore reading the documentation.

### Goal 

- Wrote the documentation for reference cause can not remember everything all the time.
- **Tutorial hell:** You get inspired by `google notes` app and want to build your own.Instead of making the app with whatever language,tools you have,you start learning the infrastructure behind databases,servers,APIs,etc.
- Do not get stuck in the understanding loop.

## Before you start

- Neither any book nor any course can teach you 100% of the things you need to know.
- This is just a overview guide to get you started about a subject.
- Do not expect that you will become expert after reading this guide or any other guide.
- It will take you a decade to master any subject.
- If you found any mistake or any thing that you think is not correct, or want to add something worthwhile, please let me know by clicking on the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of the page.
