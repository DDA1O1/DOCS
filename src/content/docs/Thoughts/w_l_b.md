- Life is not black and white.
- you can control few of the things but you cannot control all of the things.

## Priorities

- Each day, week and month your priorities are set in your mind.

- but you can change your small habits:

> - like putting a bottle of water in your work desk which must be transparent and clean.It must be pleasing to the eyes then only you pick the water bottle.If it is dull you won't even look at it.
> - like instead of going to the gym clean your home it is still an exercise.The reward is already there but not in gym where you have go everyday to see some result.

:::note
Habits should be very simple and driven by some kind of reward.
> The moment you add little complexity your habit will just exist on paper.
