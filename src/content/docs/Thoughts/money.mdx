### Origin of Money

We will not talk about history of money, but we will talk about how money works in our lives.From `Barter system` to `Gold coins`, to `Bretton Woods`, to `Fiat currency`, to `Digital currency(Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)`.With each phase, the circulation of money and access to it has only increased.

#### Fiat Currency and its impact

- Fiat currency is a currency that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver, but rather by the full faith and credit of the issuing government.Unlike any other form of money which is limited by design, fiat currency can be created at any time by the issuing government.

- Money is also called `debt` cause majority of the currency that we use today is created by the `Banking system(95%)` against an assets like `house`, `car`, `buildings`,`land`. 
- What would happen if we run out of all the assets to use as collateral?
   - For that we have created a new term called `Financial Engineering`.Where we do complex engineering to create new assets to use as collateral like `Treasury bonds`, `Municipal bonds`, `Mortgage-backed securities`, `Commercial paper`, `personal loan`, `credit card`, `CDOs`,`CDSs`, etc.
   - So do not worry about it's creation.Infact we can create money out of individual's `Energy Consumption & Expenditure` since it is also an asset for someone.
