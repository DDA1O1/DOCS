## What is it?

<div class="bold-frame">
    Collect Data -------------> Meaningful Conclusion
</div>
<div class="text-xl">
- Data can be anything from raw data to structured data to unstructured data:
</div>
>- Likes/Comments
>- tweets
>- Feedbacks
>- Images
>- Videos
>- Audio
>- Text
>- Data from APIs
>- Data from databases
>- Hovering of your mouse
>- Clicking of your mouse


## Why is it important?
<div class="text-xl">
- To make decisions/predictions for future events like:
</div>
>- New product launch
>- Future revenue and expenditure
>- how many people will buy the same product next year.
>- To invest in infrastucture projects and how feasible they are.
>- Employee cost or AWS bill.
> <div class="flex items-center"><span class="symbol mr-2">=></span>If the prediction is right then its called good data science.</div>
> <div class="flex items-center"><span class="symbol mr-2">=></span>If not then it's called layoff.</div>

>- Fraud detection.
>- Cause of an event(why someone purchased a product is it by listening a song or they saw some ads).

- There are two ways:

- The size of the dataset is comparatively less.
- Compute resources will be also used less.
