## What is it?

<div class="bold-frame">
    Collect Raw Data → Meaningful Conclusion
</div>

### Types of Data

#### Structured Data
- Database records
- API responses
- User interactions (clicks, hovers)
- Metrics (likes, comments)

#### Unstructured Data
- Images
- Videos
- Text content
- Social media posts
- User feedback


## Why is it important?

Data Science enables organizations to:

### Make Strategic Business Decisions
- Product launch strategy and market fit
- Revenue forecasting and budget planning
- Sales prediction and inventory management
- Infrastructure investment analysis
- Resource allocation and cost optimization

### Enhance Operations
- Risk assessment and fraud detection

## How it's done?

<div class="bold-frame">
    Gather Data → Label Data → Train Model(80/20) → Make Predictions
</div>


### Fraud Detection Model Example

1. **Collect Information**
   - How much money was spent and when
   - Where the purchase was made
   - What device was used to make the purchase
   - Past shopping habits
   - How old the account is and how often it's used

2. **Mark Transactions**
   <div class="text-green-500">
   - Label each purchase as either "Safe" (0) or "Suspicious" (1)
   - Expert teams review suspicious cases
   - Look at past reported fraud cases
   - Use basic rules to spot unusual activity
   </div>

3. **Train the System**
   - Use 80% of past data to teach the system
   - Clean up and organize the information
   - Pick the best method to spot patterns
   - Test different approaches to make sure it works well

4. **Put it to Work**
   - Check new purchases in real-time
   - Keep an eye on how well it's working
   - Update the system regularly with new data
   - Fine-tune how careful the system should be

### Machine Learning:

- **Data Size:** Works well with smaller datasets
- **Computing Power:** Requires less computing resources
- **Real-World Example:** 
  Think of a smart watch tracking your activities:
  - Collects data like heart rate, movement, and temperature
  - Decides if you're walking, running, or swimming
  - Uses thousands of data points
  - Can run on simple devices like your watch
  - Good enough for 90-95% accuracy in most cases


### Deep Learning:

- **Data Size:** Needs massive amounts of data
- **Computing Power:** Requires powerful computers
- **Real-World Example:**
  Think of a self-driving car's camera system:
  - Processes 4K video in real-time
  - Each second = thousands of images
  - Each image = millions of pixels
  - Must detect people, cars, signs instantly
  - Needs 99.9% accuracy for safety
  - Requires special computers to process
