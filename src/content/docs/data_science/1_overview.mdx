## What is it?

<div class="bold-frame">
    Collect Data -------------> Meaningful Conclusion
</div>

### Data can be anything from raw data to structured data to unstructured data:

- **Likes/Comments**
- **tweets**
- **Feedbacks**
- **Images**
- **Videos**
- **Text**
- **Data from APIs**
- **Data from databases**
- **Hovering of your mouse**
- **Clicking of your mouse**


## Why is it important?

### To make decisions/predictions for future events like:

- **New product launch**
- **Future revenue and expenditure**
- **how many people will buy the same product next year.**
- **To invest in infrastucture projects and how feasible they are.**
- **Employee cost or AWS bill.**
 **<div><span>=> </span>If the prediction is right then its called good data science.
 </div>**
 **<div><span >=> </span>If not then it's called layoff.</div>**
- **Fraud detection.**
- **Cause of an event(why someone purchased a product is it by listening a song or they saw some ads).**

    - **I can go on and on usecases.But you understood the point.****
</div>

## How it's done?

<div class="bold-frame">
    Gather Data --->Label Data ---> Train Model(80/20) ---> Make Predictions.
</div>

<div class="text-white">
###** Fraud Detection Model    
</div>

- **Gather Data: Amount,Address,Date,frequency of transactions.**
<div class="text-green-500">
- **Label Data: Must have to label this data whether it is valid or fraud.**
</div>
- **Train Model: train the model with 80% of the data and test the model with 20% of the data.**
- **Make Predictions: tweaking the model to make better predictions.**


## There are two ways:

  </div>
  <div class="basis-1/2  p-4 rounded-md shadow-md text-center border-2 border-orange-500">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Deep Learning</h3>
  </div>
</div>


### Machine Learning:

- **The size of the dataset is comparatively less.**
- ****Compute resources will be also used less.**
- **Example: Take any smart watch.The sensor tells your heartbeat on the go and according to that heart beat it tells you whether you are running,jogging,walking or swimming.The sensors measure your heartbeat, your surrounding moisture,wind spped,temperature etc. This data would be millions of rows and thousands of columns.This data is still manageable to train in a simple machine.If you want more data for same purpose to accuretly predict 99.9% of the time then you have to do deep learning.**


### Deep Learning:

- **The size of the dataset is comparatively more.**
- **Compute resources will be also used more.**
- **Example: Take a car which is trying to predict whether there is a human or any living being in front of the car or not by using a video camera or radio waves or any other technology.Let's take a 4K camera which captures 4K frames per second. Each second of video has multiple frames.Each frame has multiple pixels.Each pixel has its own RGB values. See the amount of data just to store a single image.This data is stored in matrices.**


## Roles

### Data Engineer:

- **Build pipelines to collect data from different sources.**
- **Build storage solutions to store data.**
- **Provide APIs to access data.**

### Data Analyst:


- **Understand data (organise it in a structured way).**
- **Clean data (remove noise).**
- **Analyse data (find patterns).**
- **Visualise data (create charts and graphs).**
- **Tools used: Python, Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, SQL, etc.**

### Data Scientist:

- **Experiment and analysis of data.**
- **Use diffetrent machine learning models.**
- **Fine tune models.**
- **Tools used: Python, R, SQL, pandas, numpy, etc.**

### Machine Learning Engineer/Scientist/AI Engineer:

- **Prediction of data.**
- **Classification of data.**
- **Deep Learning.**
- **Natural Language Processing.**
- **Use case fit.**
- **Tools used: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Spark, PyTorch, etc.**
