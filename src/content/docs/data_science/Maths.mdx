## Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It provides tools for making informed decisions based on data.

### Key Concepts

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes data using measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.

#### Population vs Sample

- **Population** 📊
  - Complete dataset
  - Example: All students in a university
  - N = Total size

- **Sample** 🔍
  - Subset of population
  - Example: 100 randomly selected students
  - n = Sample size

> **Key Point**: Sample should be representative of the population


### Measures of Central Tendency

- Measures of Central Tendency are used to describe the central or typical value of a dataset.

- **Mean**: 
  - Average of all values in a dataset
  - Formula: x̄ = (∑x) / n
  - Example: For [2,4,6,8], Mean = (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5
  - Use when:
    - Data is normally distributed
    - Need a value affected by all data points
  - Limitations:
    - Sensitive to outliers
    - May not represent central value in skewed data

- **Median**:
  - Middle value when data is ordered
  - Formula: 
    - Odd n: Value at position (n+1)/2
    - Even n: Average of values at n/2 and (n/2)+1
  - Example: For [1,3,5,7,9], Median = 5
  - Use when:
    - Data has outliers
    - Distribution is skewed
  - Limitations:
    - Not influenced by all values
    - Changes less smoothly than mean

- **Mode**:
  - Most frequently occurring value
  - Formula: Value with highest frequency
  - Example: For [1,2,2,3,4], Mode = 2
  - Use when:
    - Working with categorical data
    - Need most common value
  - Limitations:
    - Can have multiple modes
    - May not exist if all values occur once
