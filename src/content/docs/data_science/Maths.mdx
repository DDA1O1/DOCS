## Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It provides tools for making informed decisions based on data.

### Key Concepts

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes data using measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.

#### Population vs Sample

- **Population** 📊
  - Complete dataset
  - Example: All students in a university
  - N = Total size

- **Sample** 🔍
  - Subset of population
  - Example: 100 randomly selected students
  - n = Sample size

> **Key Point**: Sample should be representative of the population


### Measures of Central Tendency

- Measures of Central Tendency are used to describe the central or typical value of a dataset.

- **Mean**: 
  - Average of all values in a dataset
  - Sample Formula: x̄ = (∑x) / n
  - Population Formula: μ = (∑x) / N
  - Example: For [2,4,6,8], Mean = (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5
  - Use when:
    - Data is normally distributed
    - Need a value affected by all data points
  - Limitations:
    - Sensitive to outliers
    - May not represent central value in skewed data

- **Median**:
  - Middle value when data is ordered
  - Formula: 
    - Odd n: Value at position (n+1)/2
    - Even n: Average of values at n/2 and (n/2)+1
  - Example: For [1,3,5,7,9], Median = 5
  - Use when:
    - Data has outliers
    - Distribution is skewed
  - Limitations:
    - Not influenced by all values
    - Changes less smoothly than mean

- **Mode**:
  - Most frequently occurring value
  - Formula: Value with highest frequency
  - Example: For [1,2,2,3,4], Mode = 2
  - Use when:
    - Working with categorical data
    - Need most common value
  - Limitations:
    - Can have multiple modes
    - May not exist if all values occur once

### Measures of Dispersion

Measures of dispersion describe how spread out data points are from the center. They're crucial for:
- Understanding data variability
- Assessing data reliability
- Comparing datasets

#### Common Measures

- **Variance** (σ²)
  - Average squared deviation from mean
  - Formula: σ² = Σ(x - μ)²/n
  - Use when:
    - Detailed spread analysis needed
    - Computing statistical tests
  - Limitation: Units are squared

- **Standard Deviation** (σ)
  - Square root of variance
  - Formula: σ = √(Σ(x - μ)²/n)
  - Use when:
    - Need spread in original units
    - Analyzing normal distributions
    - Building ML models

#### Variance

Variance measures the average squared distance of data points from their mean, indicating data spread and variability.

##### Key Points

- **Definition**: Average of squared deviations from mean
- **Population Formula**: σ² = Σ(x - μ)²/N
- **Sample Formula**: s² = Σ(x - x̄)²/(n-1)

##### Why Use n-1 in Sample Variance?

The use of (n-1) instead of n in sample variance is called **Bessel's Correction**. Here's why it matters:

1. **Degrees of Freedom**
   - When calculating sample variance, we lose one degree of freedom
   - This happens because we already used one piece of information (sample mean)
   - n-1 accounts for this lost degree of freedom

2. **Bias Correction**
   - Sample variance with n tends to underestimate population variance
   - Using n-1 makes the estimator unbiased
   - Formula: s² = Σ(x - x̄)²/(n-1)

3. **Practical Impact**
   - More noticeable in small samples
   - Example:
     - n=5: 20% difference
     - n=100: 1% difference
   - Critical for accurate statistical inference

##### Real-World Example of n-1 in Sample Variance

Imagine a battery manufacturing plant:

**Population Data:**
- All 1000 batteries produced in a day
- True population mean (μ) = 1.5V
- Population readings vary between 1.3V to 1.7V
- True population variance = 0.024V²

**Sample Test:**
- We test only 5 batteries: [1.3V, 1.4V, 1.5V, 1.6V, 1.7V]
- Sample mean (x̄) = 1.5V

**Variance Calculations:**
```python
# Using n (biased)
Variance_n = Σ(x - x̄)²/5
= [(1.3-1.5)² + (1.4-1.5)² + (1.5-1.5)² + (1.6-1.5)² + (1.7-1.5)²]/5
= 0.02V² # Underestimates true variance (0.024V²)

# Using n-1 (unbiased)
Variance_n1 = Σ(x - x̄)²/4
= 0.025V² # Closer to true variance (0.024V²)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Using n: 0.02V² (off by 0.004V²)
- Using n-1: 0.025V² (off by 0.001V²)
- n-1 gives estimate closer to true population variance

This example shows how n-1 provides a better estimate of the true population variance. Note that in real situations, we usually don't know the true population variance - that's why we need good estimation methods.

> **Key Point**: Use n-1 for sample variance to get an unbiased estimate of population variance

# Example with weight data
mean = 70kg
std_dev = 5kg

# Coverage ranges
1σ range = 70 ± 5kg   = 65-75kg   (covers 68%)
2σ range = 70 ± 10kg  = 60-80kg   (covers 95%)  # Most commonly used
3σ range = 70 ± 15kg  = 55-85kg   (covers 99.7%)

# Sample of 100 people's weights
mean = 70kg
variance = 25kg²  # Standard deviation ≈ 5kg

# Practical Use
size_range = mean ± (2 × √variance)
# = 70 ± 10kg
# = 60kg to 80kg
```
