## Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It provides tools for making informed decisions based on data.

### Key Concepts

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes data using measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.

#### Population vs Sample

- **Population** 📊
  - Complete dataset
  - Example: All students in a university
  - N = Total size

- **Sample** 🔍
  - Subset of population
  - Example: 100 randomly selected students
  - n = Sample size

> **Key Point**: Sample should be representative of the population


### Measures of Central Tendency

- Measures of Central Tendency are used to describe the central or typical value of a dataset.

- **Mean**: The average value of a set of numbers.
  - *Calculation*: Sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  - *Example*: For the set {2, 3, 5}, Mean = (2 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 3.33

- **Median**: The middle value in a set of numbers.
  - *Calculation*: Arrange the numbers in order and find the middle one. If even, average the two middle numbers.
  - *Example*: For the set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, Median = 6

- **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in a set of numbers.
  - *Example*: For the set {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}, Mode = 2
  - *Note*: A set can have more than one mode or no mode at all.
