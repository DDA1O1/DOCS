## Accessibility Guidelines

When implementing animations, follow [WCAG Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG) to ensure accessibility for all users.

### Core Principles
1. **Perceivable**
   - Animations must be visible to all users
   - Provide alternatives for motion-sensitive users

2. **Operable**
   - Users must be able to control animation behavior
   - Include pause/stop functionality where appropriate

3. **Understandable**
   - Animation purpose should be clear
   - Avoid disorienting or confusing movements

4. **Robust**
   - Ensure compatibility across devices and assistive technologies
   - Provide fallbacks when animations aren't supported

### Best Practices
- Include options to reduce motion
- Avoid rapid flashing or strobing effects
- Test with various accessibility tools
- Consider users with vestibular disorders
